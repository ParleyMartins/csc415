{\Large\bf Case Study: E-learning Tools for Computing Science}

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}

With the advance of the Internet, more and more people are looking for ways to learn new things. One of these is through e-learning tools. These tools provide a method to learn and be evaluated without a physical classroom. Teachers and students from all over the world can share their knowledge as if they were together.

One of the most popular tools for this purpose is Moodle. A free software that allows teachers to upload content and grade their students based on several methods, like quizzes, open questions and file submission. It is a powerful e-learning environment, but it doesn't have everything teachers on a computing science course would need.

Courses related to programming often have assignments that are code based. Learning a new programming language, algorithm or technique is something that isn't always measured by the final code. A lot of that lives in the process and in the way the student thinks about the given problem and Moodle doesn't allow a teacher to see the development of any code.

\section{Important Previous Concepts}

To know a programming language makes it easier to understand this paper, but it's not required though. In this sections a few key concepts are explained.

\subsection{Git}

Git is a popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). It stores a local copy of your repository making it really fast and powerful. Almost all operations are offline and it's easier to create or merge branches. \ref{bib:git}

\section{Case Study}

To compare both tools the following example assignment will be used: 

Implement the Algorithm X (\ref{bib:dancing_links}) in any chosen language and analyze how this approach can be better than the regular backtracking.

\subsection{GitHub Classroom}

GitHub Classroom is a tool that allows users to create virtual environments, classrooms, and set assignments based on GitHub. The instructor can create group and individual assignments and follow up on the changes they made (throughout all the process). It's an open source software and anyone can have their own server running it. For this example a local copy of Classroom was used.

To get it running for the first time, do the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Assuming you have an account on GitHub, create an organization (we will be using AUCSC415 from now on to relate to an specific organization. Yours can have any name you want).

\item Access \href{https://classroom.github.com}{Classroom} with your GitHub credentials. 

\item Click on `Create your first classroom'. After clicking here you will need to grant access to one or more of your organizations. If you didn't create an organization in the previous step, you need to create one now.

\item Select AUCSC415. Change the name if you want. This is NOT the organization name, so you can add spaces and give a more descriptive name to it.

\item Follow the instructions on the screen if you want to add other administrators to this classroom.

\end{enumerate}

Now you have a classroom to manage your assignments and students. After doing that, you must create assignments.

\begin{enumerate}

\item In your GitHub Organization, create a repository with the base code that your students will use. This is not a required step, however you don't have any other space to explain what is required from your students. A good practice is to give any needed instructions in your README file, even if you don't have an initial code for your students.

\item Go to your classroom in GitHub Classroom and click on `Create your first assignment'. You can choose an individual or a group assignment. Group assignments can have a maximum number of people participating on them. This example will use individual assignment.

\item Give it a title and the repository where your starter code is. You can create private repositories depending on your GitHub plan.

\item Give the shown link to your students. 

\end{enumerate}

Once your students accept the request to create their assignments, a new repository (assignment-name-UserName) will be created in your organization. On your classroom dashboard you can see who accepted the request and check each repository to see their development.


\subsection{Moodle}

Moodle is a well known e-learning tool. It allows you to create your own courses and manage them with a lot of options in the most varied content. Moodle is also open source and can be customized as required.

\section{Results}

Giving starter code to students is sometimes totally necessary to an assignment. The easy way this is done in GitHub Classroom is a benefit for this system. Despite that, once a student has accepted a request, it's not possible to change the initial code anymore, so that's a negative point for Classroom. If you do change it students that have accepted before that will have outdated code (or instructions).

Another positive aspect of Classroom is that it allows the instructor to see the code anytime.
